          <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
          <h4>Groupfinder</h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/OsbornAndrew/GroupFinder" target="_blank"><img src="dnd.jpg" alt="a picture of a table filled with Dungeons & Dragons items"></a>
            <p>I'm planning on making this app after class. It's basically a tinder or bumble style app, but for finding groups to play Dungeons & Dragons, or other games. You can select what games you know how to play, and what games you are looking for in a group. You'll also be able to select what times and days you are available. This will test all the skills I have learned in my courses, and some new ones, I'm sure. I'll have to zero in on web requests, and my layout and design skills to make an app that is easy to read and use, but still functions well.</p>
          <h4>Tetronimo Falling</h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/OsbornAndrew/Legally-Not-Tetris" target="_blank"><img src="not_tetris.png" alt="A game similar to Tetris"></a>
            <p>I'm currently practicing my fundamentals in javascript, and improving my CSS and HTML by making a few simple games with graphics. I'm working on a few of these, but I don't want to get into game design. Here's one that is based around falling tetrominoes. These games help me hone my function writing skills, and offer me new challenges that I haven't had to code for yet.</p>
          <h4>Placeholder</h4>
          <a href="https://github.com/OsbornAndrew/Library-Project" target="_blank"><img src="Project.jpg" alt="The first thing that came up when I googled project"></a>
          <p>This link is to one of my projects for school. This is a placeholder project. It makes it look like I have more projects, because I didn't want to list the games I'm working on individually. This project is testing my skills in writing functions, and integrating javascript with CSS and HTML.</p>
